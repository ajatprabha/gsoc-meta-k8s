> Mentor feedback  

You have done really good job with preparing the first working prototype of plugin mechanism. Communication is going well from our point of view. One thing that maybe could be slightly improved would be progress tracking. You could use GitHub issue(s) as a place for progress updates. Keep up the good work!

> Student feedback  

The ideas given by mentors are very helpful for me to think in a direction that helps me a lot. Their experience helps in avoiding any blockers that might arise in the future because of the uninformed design decisions that I take.
