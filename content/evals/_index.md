## First Phase Evaluation
- June 24<sup>th</sup> - 28<sup>th</sup>

> Mentor feedback  

You have done really good job with preparing the first working prototype of plugin mechanism. Communication is going well from our point of view. One thing that maybe could be slightly improved would be progress tracking. You could use GitHub issue(s) as a place for progress updates. Keep up the good work!

> Student feedback  

The ideas given by mentors are very helpful for me to think in a direction that helps me a lot. Their experience helps in avoiding any blockers that might arise in the future because of the uninformed design decisions that I take.

## Second Phase Evaluation
- July 22<sup>nd</sup> - 26<sup>th</sup>

> Mentor feedback  

Implementation is going well. We can see the progress. Quality of work is also good. Communication has improved since last evaluation. Keep up the good work.

> Student feedback  

The second phase has been quite good for me because I was able to bring things together and start working to implement the PoC in a better way and take it towards a more usable solution following baby steps. After previous evaluation's feedback, I also started using GitHub Issues to track my progress which is good since now others can also see what's happening. Communication has been very good, I get replies/reviews on GitHub Issues/PRs quite fast.
